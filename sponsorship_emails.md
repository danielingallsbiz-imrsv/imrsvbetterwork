## Email 1: The Oahu Drop Sponsorship
**Target:** Local Hub (Bar/Gallery/Venue)
**Subject:** Sponsorship: Our Next Drop (Sunday Collection x Local Hub)

Hi [Name],

I’m reaching out from **The IMRSV Project**. We’re gearing up for **Our Next Drop**—a massive marketing and release party in Oahu on April 12.

**The App:**
IMRSV is a real-world collection system centered around verified “Hubs.” Our members physically "claim" spots like yours to earn participation currency, which unlocks exclusive perks, missions, and community status. We're moving from being spectators to being active contributors.

**The Drop Event:**
This isn't just an activation; it's a launch. Here’s how the day looks:
- **09:00 — 11:00** : IMRSV RUN CLUB
- **12:00 — 14:00** : CURATED NETWORKING
- **15:00 — 21:00** : DJ SET / OPEN BAR

**The Ask:**
We are looking for **just 1 sponsor** for this drop to help bring costs down. We specifically need support with **Ice, Alcohol, or Food**.

**Why Sponsor?**
By bringing our overhead down, we can reinvest more into the community. We've committed to a transparent model where **70% of all event profits** are reinvested directly back into local artists and community projects. The remaining 30% supports our small, dedicated team.

As a sponsor, you'll be featured as a core **Hub** in our app, driving high-value, intentional traffic to your door through our mission-based exploration game.

Are you open to a quick chat about joining the drop?

Best,
Daniel
Founder and COO, The IMRSV Project

## Email 2: release Party Sponsorship
**Target:** Local Provider (DJ Studio / Ice Provider)
**Subject:** Sponsorship Invitation: Supporting the Oahu Drop

Hi [Name],

I’m writing to you regarding **Our Next Drop**—the official marketing and release party for Sunday Collection, hitting Oahu on April 12.

**How the App Works:**
The IMRSV app turns city exploration into a collaborative game. By visiting "Hubs," users unlock status and earn currency that reinvests back into the local culture. It’s an intentional ecosystem built to stop extraction and start participation.

**The Oahu Itinerary:**
- **09:00 — 11:00** : IMRSV RUN CLUB
- **12:00 — 14:00** : CURATED NETWORKING
- **15:00 — 21:00** : DJ SET / OPEN BAR

**The Ask:**
We’re looking for a singular partner to sponsor **Ice, Alcohol, or Food** for this release. We only work with **just 1 sponsor** per category to maintain exclusivity.

**70/30 Impact Model:**
Our goal is reinvestment. We put **70% of profits** into the local community via our Restoration Fund and 30% toward our small team. Your sponsorship directly enables more of those funds to hit the ground in Oahu.

Would you be interested in being the featured Hub for our Oahu drop?

Best,
Daniel
Founder and COO, The IMRSV Project
